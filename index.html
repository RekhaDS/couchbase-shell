<p>Couchbase Shell is a developer-oriented REPL intended to make it easy to interactively explore a Couchbase Cluster and its data through its services.  Through simple commands, documents in Couchbase can be connected with pipes to other simple commands to visualize, reduce, transform, import and export data.</p>

<p>It runs as a single, batteries-included binary and works with the cluster on your local system, on the cloud, or in your datacenter.  Download now. </p>

<p>Want to access data directly, through N1QL query, FTS or other Couchbase services?  Seeing the content of a document is easy, and querying for multiple documents, even those of different schemas, is also easy to understand quickly. </p>

(screenshot of a doc get and then a query that returns multiple documents)

<p>Need to quickly see status of dev, test and prod clusters?  The shell can group your clusters in a way that makes sense to you, and give you a quick listing of what is healthy or what is running where.   It can also allow you to quickly see the status of something in production and compare it to development.</p>

<p>Need to quickly mock up some data for exploring an idea?  Define a tera template for the kind of data in use and run a command to add documents quickly. </p>

(screenshot of tera with 500 million items being added)

<p>Have some data in JSON, CSV or other common file formats to import?  Transform them if needed and then quickly add them through a pipeline of commands. </p>

<p>That's just scratching the surface.  Learn more about configuring, recipes, the ingredients or contributing to Couchbase Shell.</p>
